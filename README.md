2. Scopes: select `bot`. Permissions: include at least `BAN_MEMBERS`, `VIEW_CHANNEL`, `SEND_MESSAGES`.
3. Copy the generated URL and open it to invite the bot to your server.

### 4) Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file at the project root:
```env
# Required
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
PROTECTED_CHANNEL_ID=1427761223117701234
DELETE_WINDOW_SECONDS=300



How to get a channel ID:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

## üóÇÔ∏è Logging (Logs)

- This bot uses a **daily rotating log system** (one `.log` file per day) stored in the `logs/` directory at the project root.
- Logs record important actions: connections, detected messages, deletions, bans, and errors.
- The `logs/` directory is created automatically when the bot starts if it does not exist.
- To review logs, navigate to the `logs/` folder and open the current day's log file, for example, `autoban.log`.
- Log rotation ensures log files do not grow too large.

### Why is logging important?

- It facilitates auditing of the bot's automatic actions.
- Useful for troubleshooting errors or unexpected behavior.
- Improves traceability of moderation on your server.


## üß™ Usage

- When a user posts in the protected channel, the bot will ban them and optionally delete recent messages.
- The bot can post a warning message in the channel so users know not to post there.
- If admin commands are implemented, ensure your admin role is set via `ADMIN_ROLE_ID`.

Common admin tasks (examples):
- Show current settings
- Toggle cleanup or change cleanup minutes
- Update the warning message

Refer to your command list (slash or prefix) if available in the code.

## üîê Permissions & Intents

- Intents: enable the intents required by your implementation (commonly Server Members).
- Permissions: the bot should have `BAN_MEMBERS`, `VIEW_CHANNEL`, and `SEND_MESSAGES`. Grant only what is necessary.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- Bot offline
  - Check `DISCORD_TOKEN` and that the token is valid.
  - Confirm required intents are enabled in the Developer Portal.
  - Review console logs for exceptions on startup.
- Ban not working
  - Ensure the bot‚Äôs role is above the target user‚Äôs role.
  - Confirm the bot has `BAN_MEMBERS` permission in the server.
  - Verify `PROTECTED_CHANNEL_ID` is correct and the bot can read the channel.
- Channel ID not found
  - Make sure Developer Mode is enabled and you copied the correct ID.
